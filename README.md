# MovieRecommendationSystem

A Recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It is a type of information filtering system which attempts to predict the preferences of a user, and make suggests based on these preferences, especially in streaming services. For streaming services like Netflix, recommendation systems are essential for helping users find new movies to enjoy. Objective of the recommendation system is to achieve customer loyalty by providing relevant content and maximising the time spent by a user on your website or channel. This also helps in increasing customer engagement.
